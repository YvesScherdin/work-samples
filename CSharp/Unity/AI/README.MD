# UNITY-Project - AI-System (work samples)

The following project contains work samples of an C# Unity AI system I wrote for [my Unity mage game](https://spiele-oder-so.de/mage-game.html).

The intention was to create different agent behaviors by simpyl composing behaviour components (like perceptions and skills).
The configuration would be done within UI. The composition is yet done in code.

### Action configuration

In the following screenshots you can see the configurable AI components, such as...

- [Combat settings](./Source/Data/AICombatSettings.cs)
- [Action options](./Source/Data/AIActionOption.cs)
- [Additional modules](./Source/Data/Modules)
